Q1. What are the primitive data types in JavaScript? List all of them with one example each.
--->primitive datatype means built-in datatype
    LIST:
    -string
    let str = "shashank"
    -boolian 
    let bool = true
    -number
    let num = 10
    -null
    -undefined

Q2. Explain the difference between null and undefined with examples.
--->null: null means blank place
    like let arr = []

    undefined: undefined means blank space, value not declare 
    like let arr = []

Q3. What will be the output of typeof NaN and why?
---> output of typeof NaN - Number


Q4. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? When should you use each?
---> 
    == is use to compare two variables, numbers, strings etc
    == check both side without their datatype, case

    === is also use for compare two  variables, numbers, strings etc
    === check both side with their datatype
    === check strickly in both side
    === use when we want to check both side is eqal with strickly



Q5. Explain the difference between if-else and switch statements. When would you prefer one over the other?
--->if-else: if else statement use when we want to perform any action base on condition 
             if condition is true then if block execute otherwise else block execute
    
    switch statement: switch statement use when we want to perfrom event base on multiple condition 


Q6. What is a ternary operator? Write its syntax and explain with an example.
--->ternary operator is a same as if-else condition with shortcut 
    syntax: variable =  condition ? true : false
    eg :    let persentage = 35;
             let result = persentage > 34 ? "pass" : "Fail" 

Q7. What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript? List at least 5 falsy values.



Q8. Can we use multiple conditions in a single if statement? Explain with the help of logical operators (&&, ||, !).

---> yes we use multiple condition in single if statement using logical operators 
    we use && operator 
    when we use && operator then both condition want true

    || or operator 
    using || operator only one codition want true

    ! not operator 
    ! means 

Q9. What is the difference between for, while, and do-while loops? When would you use each?

--->for loop :
    for loop use for perform repeted task 
    in for loop we must declare starting and ending value 

    while loop
    while loop  use for perform loop operation 
    in while loop we give condition 
    loop work whenever loop condition become true if condition become false loop termenated


Q10. Explain what an infinite loop is and how can it be avoided.
--->infinite loop means loop condition become always true 
    loop run  check condition - true - loop run check condition - true and repete again infinite

    we use break for avoided infinete loop

Q11. What is the purpose of break and continue statements in loops? Give one example of each.
--->break :
    break use in loop , when condition become true then break entire loop

    continue:
    continue use when we want skip this loop and continue next loop

Q12. How does a for...of loop differ from a for...in loop?
--->for...of 
    for...of use for array and return index value 

    for...in
    for...in use for object and return key and value  


Q13. Explain the difference between map() and forEach(). When would you use one over the other?
--->map()
    map() use when we want to perform any operation on every element of array and return new array

    forEach()
    forEach() use when we want tp perform any operation on every element of array and not reaturn 




Q14. What is the difference between filter() and find() methods?

--->
    filter(): when we use condition base and return multiple value if condition become true
    find(): when we use condition base  and return first element which become condition true

Q15. How does reduce() work? Explain with a simple example.
---> reduce() return - last return value , element and index
        arr[0] is default LRV

Q16. What is the difference between push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() methods?
---> push(): push() insert element from last in array
     pop(): pop() delete element from last in array
     shift(): shift() delete from start
     unshift(): unshift() inster from start



Q17. Explain any 5 string methods with their use cases.
---> length(): to check length of string
     reverse(): to convert string reverse
     toUppercase(): to convert uppercase alphbet
     toLowercase():to convert lowercase alph
     split():to convert from string to array


Q18. What is the difference between slice() and substring() in strings?
--->slice():in slice we give star and end and return  section of a string
    substring(): in substring we

Q19. How do you access properties of an object? Explain dot notation vs bracket notation.
---> using . we can access properties of an object
    let obj = {
        name : "shashank"
        age : "20"
    }
    obj.name
    obj[age]

Q20. How can you loop through all keys and values of an object?
--->we use for in to loop all keys and vakues of an object
    let obj = {
        name : "shashank"
        age : "20"
    }
